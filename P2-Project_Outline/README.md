# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
GoForage is a tracking tool for people interested in foraging.  Users will be able to use geolocation to catalog their finds and possibly view a database of wild plants that can be found in the general location and season.  

Users will be able to log into their accounts where they can view their catalog including the locations of where the item was found.  Users will be able to view other user submitted finds in the area.  

Beginner foragers will find this app useful because they can use the geolocation function along with season to learn what plants they are most likely to find while hiking in their given area.  The more experienced forager will find most useful the ability to catalog finds with the location of where they found said item.  This will allow the user to reference items previously found and know when and where it was found for future foraging adventures.  


### Features
User Login
Users will be able to create/log in and authenticate account.  Each user will have their own catalog of foraged items, including date and location of where the item was found.  
Photo Upload
User will be able to upload photos of items they have found.  
Geolocation
User will be able to view a database of plants categorized by season and location.  They will be able to catalog their finds as well as location of their finds.  User can view what other people in their area.
Search
User will be able to search through a database of plants for more information about said plant.  

### Technologies
I’ll likely be using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, and Thymeleaf templates; however, I am open to discussing this and finding better alternatives.  

### What I'll Have to Learn
I’ll need to learn to use an API for geolocation as well as retrieving information from a database of over one million plants.
